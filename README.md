# cat

## A well-known UNIX command-line program that concatenates and prints files.

### NOTES
1. This project is expected to compile and run on all desktop and mobile platforms. You can build it using CMake.
2. Command-line options it accepts are different from both GNU and BSD implementation. For example, -h can be used to get help message and -V can be used to get version information. Also, some options are not implemented.
3. I have started to implement it when I saw it on [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-cat).
4. I consider adding localization and support for reading different kind of files on my spare time.
